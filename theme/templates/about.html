            <h1>The Open Source Pin Board</h1>
            <p>Pinry was the first and remains the best open source pin board alternative
                to sites like Wookmark and Pinterest. These sites are great for sharing
                and interacting with other people but if something goes wrong or the
                service shuts down you lose everything. Pinry allows you to host your
                own board knowing that it will always be there.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Contacting The Developers</h2>
            <p>The best way to get help with Pinry is using our GitHub issue tracker.
                Alternatively you can email us but we aren't as quick to respond to
                those.</p>

            <h2>Deploying Pinry</h2>
            <p>Our supported and suggested way to deploy Pinry is using Docker. We provide
                support and instructions for that over at the docker-pinry GitHub
                repository. If you'd like a different setup then check out the hundreds of
                tutorials for production Django deployment found via Google.</p>

            <h2>Want to be a contributor?</h2>
            <p>The best way is to clone our GitHub repo, build out a feature
                or fix some bugs in a clean style that matches our own and if we
                like it we'll merge it! If you continuously provide Pinry with
                good updates we'll contact you or you can contact us with your
                track record and we can discuss getting you commit privileges.</p>
