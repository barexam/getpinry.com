            <h2>Want to be a contributor?</h2>
            <p>The best way is to clone our BitBucket repo, build out a feature
                or fix some bugs in a clean style that matches our own and if we
                like it we'll merge it! If you continuously provide Pinry with
                good updates we'll contact you or you can contact us with your
                track record and we can discuss getting you commit privileges.</p>
