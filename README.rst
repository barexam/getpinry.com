getpinry.com
============

Statically generated website using Pelican for getpinry.com.


Requirements
------------

Just Pelican and ghp-import both of which are in the ``requirements.txt`` file
for easy virtualenv/pip install. However, I do make heavy use of a Makefile like
all Pelican projects, if you are on Windows you might have some trouble.
