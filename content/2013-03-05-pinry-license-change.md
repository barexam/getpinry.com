Title: Pinry License Change
Category: Pinry
Author: Isaac Bythewood

Pinry is now releasing under the AGPLv3 license instead of the Simplified BSD
License. The change is a small yet significant one and means that if you are
modifying and releasing Pinry code you must now make your changes/code public.

## Does It Affect You?

If you are publishing a closed source project that uses modified Pinry code
please release that modified Pinry code, if you are using Pinry privately/not
releasing a product that makes use of Pinry then don't worry about it! All the
companies and people that are using Pinry internally and have changed Pinry code
can go ahead and keep doing so.


## Why?

Since we are keeping almost all of the Pinry source open and releasing a hosted
service we don't want someone to come along and grab our code and create a
competing service without releasing their code as well. We are not trying to
get rid of competition, we think competition helps companies grow, we just want
to make sure that competition plays by the same rules we do when it comes to
keeping Pinry open source.
